		</figure> 
		<p>I have created a variety of different 3D and 2D art pieces with both the Maya 3D softwar and things like photoshop and illustrator. To the right there is an example of one of the 3D scenes that I made in the Maya 3D software. The example I choose to show is actually the first project I ever did both at Parkland college and in Maya itself.</p>
