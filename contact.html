		<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
		<p>In my free time, I like to make art work be it actul hand drawing and painting or digital art on a computer.I also spend time making small animations and working with special effects in after effects to make fun little videos for me and my friends and just to get some practice in. Sadly I dont have all the software at home so I have to come to campus to work on most things.</p>

				<figcaption>Art Example</figcaption>
		</figure> 
		<p>I have created a variety of different 3D and 2D art pieces with both the Maya 3D softwar and things like photoshop and illustrator. To the right there is an example of one of the 3D scenes that I made in the Maya 3D software. The example I choose to show is actually the first project I ever did both at Parkland college and in Maya itself.</p>
